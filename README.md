#ia-binder

ia-binder is a Python-based utility that binds a ZIP archive to an image file. This technique allows you to share the image normally while discreetly concealing the contents of the ZIP file inside. Most users will only see a regular image, but those familiar with the technique can extract the hidden data.

This tool is particularly useful for steganography challenges in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
